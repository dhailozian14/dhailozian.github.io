                <h1>Let it Go</h1>

                <p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>
Not a footprint to be seen<br>
A kingdom of isolation,<br>
And it looks like I’m the queen.</p>

<p>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>
Couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried</p>

<p>Don’t let them in, don’t let them see<br>
Be the good girl you always have to be<br>
Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know<br>
Well, now they know</p>

<p>Let it go, let it go<br>
Can’t hold it back anymore<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
Turn away and slam the door</p>

<p>I don’t care<br>
What they’re going to say<br>
Let the storm rage on,<br>
The cold never bothered me anyway</p>

<p>It’s funny how some distance<br>
Makes everything seem small<br>
And the fears that once controlled me<br>
Can’t get to me at all</p>

<p>It’s time to see what I can do<br>
To test the limits and break through<br>
No right, no wrong, no rules for me<br>
I’m free</p>

<p>Let it go, let it go<br>
I am one with the wind and sky<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
You’ll never see me cry</p>

<p>Here I stand<br>
And here I'll stay<br>
Let the storm rage on</p>

<p>My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br>
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br>
I’m never going back,<br>
The past is in the past</p>

<p>Let it go, let it go<br>
And I'll rise like the break of dawn<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
That perfect girl is gone</p>

<p>Here I stand<br>
In the light of day<br>
Let the storm rage on,<br>
The cold never bothered me anyway</p>
